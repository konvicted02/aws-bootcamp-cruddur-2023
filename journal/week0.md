### Install AWS CLI

####  1. Into gitpod

To install AWS CLI into gitpod, in the "workspace" folder, we followed these [AWS CLI install and update instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for Linux systems:

  a. Download the installation file

  ```sh
  curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
  ```

  b. Unzip the installer
  
  ```sh
  unzip awscliv2.zip
  ```
  
  c. Run the install program
  
  ```sh
  sudo ./aws/install
  ```
  
Then to install the AWS CLI when our Gitpod enviroment launches, we updated our `.gitpod.yml` to include the following tasks:

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

####  2. On macOS

We also tried to install the AWS CLI on macOS by following the [AWS CLI install and update instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for macOS systems. See below a screenshot as proof.
